# GNN-based-Three-phase-matrix-converter
GNN-based Three-Phase Matrix Converter: Implements a Graph Neural Network to model and predict output voltages of a three-phase matrix converter. Captures switching behavior, input/output dynamics, and load interactions for intelligent converter analysis, waveform prediction, and performance optimization.
